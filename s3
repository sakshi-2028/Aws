🧠 What is Amazon S3?
Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service) is an object storage service that lets you store and retrieve any amount of data at any time from anywhere.
It’s highly scalable, durable (99.999999999% = 11 nines), and secure.
You store data as objects inside buckets.


📦 Key Concepts :

| Term              | Description                                                    |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Bucket**        | A container that stores objects (like folders in cloud).       |
| **Object**        | The actual file you upload (data + metadata).                  |
| **Key**           | Unique name (path) of an object within a bucket.               |
| **Region**        | Each bucket exists in a single AWS region (e.g., `us-east-1`). |
| **Versioning**    | Keeps multiple versions of the same object.                    |
| **Storage Class** | Defines cost, performance, and retrieval time.                 |


🧱 How S3 Stores Data
Each object has:
Key → name (like images/photo.jpg)
Value → the actual data
Metadata → info about the file (e.g., content-type)
Version ID → if versioning is enabled


🔐 S3 Security
S3 provides multiple ways to control access 👇

1️⃣ IAM Policies
Grant permissions to users or roles to access S3.
Example IAM policy for full bucket access:

{
  "Effect": "Allow",
  "Action": "s3:*",
  "Resource": ["arn:aws:s3:::my-bucket", "arn:aws:s3:::my-bucket/*"]
}

2️⃣ Bucket Policies
Control access at bucket level (JSON-based, like firewall rules).
Example public read policy:

{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": "*",
      "Action": ["s3:GetObject"],
      "Resource": ["arn:aws:s3:::my-bucket/*"]
    }
  ]
}

3️⃣ ACL (Access Control List)
Older method of managing permissions (object-level).
Still used for legacy integrations.

4️⃣ Block Public Access
AWS recommends turning this ON by default to prevent data leaks.


Used for:
1)Hosting static websites
2)Backups
3)Storing logs or media files
4)Big data lake storage


🎯 Common Interview Questions
Question	Answer
1)What is S3?	
Object storage service to store and retrieve data from anywhere.
2)Difference between S3 and EBS?
S3 = object storage, EBS = block storage (attached to EC2).
3)What is a bucket?	Container for objects (files).
What is the max size of an S3 object?	5 TB.
4)How do you secure an S3 bucket?
IAM, bucket policy, encryption, block public access.
5)What is versioning?
Maintains multiple versions of the same object.
6)What is lifecycle policy?	
Automatically transitions or deletes data after certain days.
7)What are S3 storage classes?	
Standard, Intelligent-Tiering, IA, Glacier, Deep Archive, etc.
7)What is S3 Transfer Acceleration?
Speeds uploads using AWS edge locations.
8)Difference between ACL and Bucket Policy?	
ACL = object-level, Bucket Policy = bucket-level access control.
9)How to prevent public access?	
Enable “Block all public access” and use IAM policies.
