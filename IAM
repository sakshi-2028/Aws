Aws IAM (Identity and access Management):

IAM ensures the right people have the right access to the right resources at the right time.

OR

Identity and access Management is a web service that helps you securly access to aws resources.You use Iam to control who is authenticated (sign-in) and authorized (has permisiion) to use resources.

Limitation of IAM :

1)IAM user limits is 5000 per aws account.you can add 10 user at one time. 2)your are also limited to 1000 IAM roles under AWS account. 3)default limits of managed polices attaced to an IAM role and IAM user is 10. 4)IAM user can be member of 10 group(max). 5)we can assign two access key to an IAM user

Benefits of IAM :

1)shared access to you aws account. 2)Granular permissions. :you can grant diffrent permission to diffrent people for diffrent resources. 3)Secure access to Aws resources of application that run on amazon ec2. 4)Multifactor Authrntication (MFA). 5)Identity fedration. :you can allow user who have alrady password elsewhere :facebook google then you can login

⚙️ Key Features of IAM Feature Description 👤 User Management Create, manage, and delete user accounts securely. Each user gets unique credentials (username, password, access key). 👥 Group Management Organize users into groups to apply common permissions easily. 🧾 Roles and Permissions Assign roles to define what actions (like read, write, delete) are allowed on which resources. 🔑 Policy-Based Access Control Define policies (JSON documents in AWS) that specify who can do what on which resources. 🔐 Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) Adds an extra layer of security (password + OTP, for example). 🕵️ Temporary Credentials Provide short-term access (e.g., for applications or third-party services). 🌍 Federated Access / SSO (Single Sign-On) Allow users from external systems (like Google Workspace, Microsoft AD) to access resources securely. 🧠 Least Privilege Principle Give users only the permissions necessary to perform their job — nothing more. 🧩 Integration with Other Services IAM integrates tightly with services like EC2, S3, Azure Blob, etc., to control access at a granular level. 📜 Auditing and Logging All IAM activities are logged for security review and compliance. (e.g., AWS CloudTrail logs IAM actions.)

IAM Term: 1)Principle 2)Request 3)Authentication 4)Authorized 5)Action/Operation 6)Resources

You can create a new IAM Policy in the Aws management console 3 ways. 1)json :you can create your own json syntax 2)/visual editor : you can constract a new policy from scratch in the visual editor . 3)Import: you can import a managed policy within your aws account.
