🧠 AWS EC2 – Complete Overview
🚀 1. What is EC2?
Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) is a web service that provides resizable compute capacity in the cloud.
It allows you to launch virtual machines (instances) that can run applications, host websites, or process data.
👉 Think of EC2 as your virtual server in the AWS cloud.

⚙️ 2. Key Features of EC2
Feature	Description
1)Elasticity	You can scale capacity up or down easily.
2)Pay-as-you-go	You pay only for the compute time you use.
3)Variety of Instance Types	Optimized for different workloads (compute, memory, storage, GPU).
4)Custom AMIs	You can create and reuse custom machine images.
5)Security	Uses key pairs, IAM roles, and security groups.
6)Monitoring	Integrated with CloudWatch for metrics and alerts.

🧱 3. EC2 Components
🧩 a) Amazon Machine Image (AMI)
A pre-configured template used to create an instance.
Contains:
1)OS (Ubuntu, Windows, etc.)
2)Application Server
3)Any pre-installed software
4)You can use:
5)AWS-provided AMIs
6)Marketplace AMIs
7)Custom AMIs you create yourself

🧩 b) Instance Type
Defines the hardware configuration (CPU, memory, storage, network).
Categories:
1)General Purpose → t2.micro, t3.medium
2)Compute Optimized → c5.large
3)Memory Optimized → r5.large
4)Storage Optimized → i3.large
5)GPU → p3, g4dn

🧩 c) Key Pair
Used for secure SSH login into instances.
Public key → stored in AWS
Private key (.pem) → kept with you

🧩 d) Security Group
Acts as a virtual firewall controlling inbound/outbound traffic to instances.
Example rules:
Inbound: Allow port 22 (SSH), port 80 (HTTP)
Outbound: Allow all traffic


🧩 EBS (Elastic Block Store)
Like a hard disk attached to EC2.
You can detach/attach it to any instance.

Types of EBS:
gp3 – General Purpose SSD
io2 – High performance SSD
st1 – Throughput optimized HDD
sc1 – Cold HDD (low-cost storage)
💡 Snapshots:
EBS snapshots are backups stored in S3 — you can restore them anytime.

🧩 f) Elastic IP
Static public IP that remains the same even if you stop/start the instance.

🧩 Key EC2 Components  :

| Component                       | Description                                                               |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Instance**                    | The actual virtual server running in AWS.                                 |
| **AMI (Amazon Machine Image)**  | A pre-configured template (OS + software) used to launch instances.       |
| **Instance Type**               | Defines hardware (CPU, Memory, Storage). Example: `t2.micro`, `m5.large`. |
| **EBS (Elastic Block Store)**   | Persistent disk attached to an instance (like a hard drive).              |
| **Key Pair**                    | Used for SSH authentication (private + public key).                       |
| **Security Group**              | Virtual firewall controlling inbound/outbound traffic.                    |
| **Elastic IP**                  | Static public IP that stays even if you stop/restart the instance.        |
| **Elastic Load Balancer (ELB)** | Distributes traffic evenly across multiple instances.                     |
| **Auto Scaling Group (ASG)**    | Automatically increases or decreases instances based on demand.           |


⚙️ EC2 Instance Lifecycle :

| State          | Description                    |
| -------------- | ------------------------------ |
| **Pending**    | Instance is being launched     |
| **Running**    | Active and ready to use        |
| **Stopped**    | Powered off but data preserved |
| **Terminated** | Deleted permanently            |


🧩 Elastic Load Balancer (ELB)
Distributes incoming network traffic across multiple EC2 instances to ensure high availability and fault tolerance.

🔹 Types of Load Balancers:
Type	Use Case
1)Application Load Balancer (ALB)	Works at Layer 7 (HTTP/HTTPS). Routes traffic based on URL/path.
2)Network Load Balancer (NLB)	Works at Layer 4 (TCP/UDP). Best for high performance/low latency.
3)Gateway Load Balancer (GLB)	Used for third-party firewalls/security appliances.
4)Classic Load Balancer (CLB)	Old version; supports Layer 4/7.

💡 Example:
If you have 3 EC2 web servers, ALB sends traffic evenly between them — if one fails, it automatically routes to healthy ones.


🔄 Auto Scaling Group (ASG)
Automatically adds or removes EC2 instances based on traffic or CPU usage.
Ensures application availability and cost efficiency.
Uses CloudWatch alarms (e.g., if CPU > 70%, launch 2 new instances).
When demand drops, it terminates extra instances.


🌐 Elastic IP

A static public IP address you can attach to your instance.
Helps when you need a fixed IP (for DNS, external apps, etc.).
Remains constant even if instance restarts.

| Model             | Description                                           |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| On-Demand     | Pay per hour/second; no commitment                    |
| Reserved      | Commit 1 or 3 years for cheaper rates                 |
| Spot          | Bid for unused capacity (up to 90% cheaper)           |
| Savings Plans | Commit usage amount ($/hour) instead of instance type |
