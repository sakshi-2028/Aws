🧠 AWS EC2 – Complete Overview
🚀 1. What is EC2?

Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) is a web service that provides resizable compute capacity in the cloud.
It allows you to launch virtual machines (instances) that can run applications, host websites, or process data.

👉 Think of EC2 as your virtual server in the AWS cloud.

⚙️ 2. Key Features of EC2
Feature	Description
Elasticity	You can scale capacity up or down easily.
Pay-as-you-go	You pay only for the compute time you use.
Variety of Instance Types	Optimized for different workloads (compute, memory, storage, GPU).
Custom AMIs	You can create and reuse custom machine images.
Security	Uses key pairs, IAM roles, and security groups.
Monitoring	Integrated with CloudWatch for metrics and alerts.

🧱 3. EC2 Components
🧩 a) Amazon Machine Image (AMI)
A pre-configured template used to create an instance.
Contains:
OS (Ubuntu, Windows, etc.)
Application Server
Any pre-installed software
You can use:
AWS-provided AMIs
Marketplace AMIs
Custom AMIs you create yourself

🧩 b) Instance Type
Defines the hardware configuration (CPU, memory, storage, network).
Categories:
General Purpose → t2.micro, t3.medium
Compute Optimized → c5.large
Memory Optimized → r5.large
Storage Optimized → i3.large
GPU → p3, g4dn

🧩 c) Key Pair
Used for secure SSH login into instances.
Public key → stored in AWS
Private key (.pem) → kept with you

🧩 d) Security Group
Acts as a virtual firewall controlling inbound/outbound traffic to instances.
Example rules:
Inbound: Allow port 22 (SSH), port 80 (HTTP)
Outbound: Allow all traffic


🧩 e) Elastic Block Store (EBS)
Persistent block storage attached to EC2 instances.
Data persists even after stopping the instance.

Types: gp3 (SSD), io2 (high IOPS), st1 (HDD).

🧩 f) Elastic IP
Static public IP that remains the same even if you stop/start the instance.
