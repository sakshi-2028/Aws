AMI (Amazon Machine Image)

An AMI is a pre-configured template that contains all the information required to launch an EC2 instance
(virtual server) on AWS.

In simple terms
An AMI is like a snapshot/template of a server that contains everything needed to create a virtual machine.

* What an AMI  includes
1)Operating System- Amazon linux, ubuntu , window , etc
2)Preinstalled software - web server , Docker ,Java , PHP etc
3)Application code & code & config -your backend ,enviroment setup.
4)Permissions - which AWS accounts can use this AMI
5)Root volume snapshot - EBS snapshot of the disk.

* why AMI IS important 
Launch multiple identical EC2 instances
Faster recovery (recreate server in minutes)
Used in Auto Scaling Groups
Useful for backup and migration
Ensures consistent environments (dev / staging / prod)

* Types of AMIs
AWS Managed AMIs – Amazon Linux, Ubuntu, Windows
Marketplace AMIs – paid or free images from vendors
Custom AMIs – created by you from an EC2 instance

* AMI lifecycle (common flow)
Launch EC2
Install software & configure app
Create AMI from that instance
Use AMI to launch new EC2s or scale


* Key points to remember
AMIs are region-specific
AMIs are immutable (can’t be edited, only recreated)
Backed by EBS or Instance Store
Billing applies for EBS snapshots, not the AMI itself


| AMI                    | Snapshot                |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Blueprint for EC2      | Backup of EBS volume    |
| Used to launch EC2     | Used to restore volume  |
| Contains OS + software | Contains disk data only |


How do you secure AMIs?
Patch OS regularly
Remove hardcoded secrets
Use IAM roles (no keys)
Encrypt EBS volumes
Use Golden AMIs
